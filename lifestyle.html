<h2>Pilates - A guide</h2>
 <h3>What is Pilates</h3>
 <p>Pilates is a type of exercise and body conditioning first used as a way for dancers to recover from injury. Today, people other than dancers do Pilates for its health benefits. It highlights precise movements, controlled breathing, and muscle engagement, enhancing muscle tone and stability. </p>
 <h3>Pilates vs Yoga</h3>
 <p> Yoga emphasizes mind-body connection and offers physical benefits like strength, flexibility, and balance, often with meditation. Pilates focuses on core strength through structured exercises and slowly gets more challenging. There are various forms of yoga, while Pilates typically follows a standard set of exercises with the chance to advance with help from an instructor.</p>
 <h3>Equipments for Beginners</h3>
 <p>Generally, a yoga mat is too thin, and with Pilates’ rolling exercises it could be uncomfortable. If your budget allows, invest in a thicker, softer mat. Alternatively, you can place a thick towel or blanket over your mat.Some teachers and classes may use additional props or equipment. Props are meant to support, add variety, or increase the difficulty level.Small props can include the magic circle, light weights (or canned food or water bottles), a mini ball, therabands, and even the Swiss ball.</p>
 <h3>Workout Plan</h3>
 <p> If you had to choose one thing to focus on or master in the beginning, it would be your breath.Your breath adds vitality, working in sync with and serving as the key to efficient core engagement. It’s the foundation of every exercise.A consistent Pilates practice of three times per week is ideal. Twice is sufficient, and a daily practice is possible and nontaxing on the body. Aim to find a rhythm that works for you.Your body is different from moment to moment. As your self-awareness increases, you’ll be more in tune with what your body needs.Every workout will and should be different. On the occasion that you feel tired, pace yourself. If appropriate, strive to do some, if not all, of the exercises to feel invigorated again.</p>
 <h3>How to Start</h3>
 <p> Talk to your doctor. This is especially important if you have health concerns or are recovering from an injury.Find a qualified instructor. Whether you're taking in-person or online classes, look for an instructor who's part of a professional organization or get a suggestion from someone you trust.Begin slowly. Even if you're experienced in fitness, this will help you avoid injury.Choose a mat or reformer. Don't assume mat exercises are easier than using a reformer; both have benefits and challenges.Consider your needs and budget. Consider studio vs. home practice, group vs. solo, and mat vs.reformer, based on your preferences and budget.</p>

If your mind wanders, gently bring it back to your breath without judgment.
Benefits: Reduces stress, increases awareness of the present moment, and can help manage anxiety.</p>
<h3>Body Scan Meditation</h3>
